Welcome to my blog! This has been long overdue and currently a work in progress, but this will eventually be a place where I hope to be regularly posting updates on projects that I'm working on, interesting things I've learned, or random thoughts I have.

A lot of my posts will likely be about software engineering, game design/development, emulation, or information security. I'm far from an expert in any of these areas but I find them fascinating to learn about, so if you're interested in these topics I hope you'll check back soon. Some posts won't fall under any of those categories, but they're a safe bet for the type of content I'll be posting.

In the meantime, since there isn't much to see just yet, feel free to read some things I have written for Tallan:

- [Introduction to Blazor](https://www.tallan.com/blog/2021/01/19/introduction-to-blazor/)
- [Exploring Buffer Overflows in C, Part One: Theory](https://www.tallan.com/blog/2019/03/07/exploring-buffer-overflows-in-c-part-one-theory/)
- [Exploring Buffer Overflows in C, Part Two: The Exploit](https://www.tallan.com/blog/2019/04/04/exploring-buffer-overflows-in-c-part-two-the-exploit/)
